Remarks: Currently our program handles incoming packets, but fails on a data send from the server to the client. Sendto() fails with an error message, invalid argument and even after 3 hours with a Network Programming mentor, we could not diagnose and remedy this issue. Eventually, after moving around pieces of our code sendto() did run without the invalid argument error, but still had issues when sending data. The write request ran into similar issues. Following the RFC to the best of our abilities, we were still able to handle multiple connections, signals and timeouts. If we are able to receive any partial credit for our implementation that would be very greatly appreciated.
